Ribbon is an interactive web visualization tool for viewing genomic alignments of short/long reads or assembled contigs to any reference genome. 

Ribbon is available online at genomeribbon.com and can even read large bam files straight from your computer without a local install. 

## Local deployment
If you need to deploy Ribbon locally, here are the steps:
1. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if you don't already have it.
2. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marianattestad/ribbon
   cd ribbon
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. Double click on `index.html`

That is the entire installation process for Ribbon. Don't you love web applications?
