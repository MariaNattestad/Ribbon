Ribbon is an interactive web visualization tool for viewing genomic alignments of short/long reads or assembled contigs to any reference genome. 

Ribbon is available online at genomeribbon.com and can even read large bam files straight from your computer without a local install. 

## Local deployment

If you need to deploy Ribbon locally, here are the steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/marianattestad/ribbon`

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

That is the entire installation process for Ribbon. Don't you love web applications?
