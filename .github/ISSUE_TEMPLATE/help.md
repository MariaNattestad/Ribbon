Hi! Thanks for using Ribbon/SplitThreader.

If you are having issues with your particular files, please try the following first and include the results in the issue.
1. Open the developer console because there could be some more detailed error messages there.
2. You can load the SV calls on their own to check them separately from the coverage, and also load the coverage on its own in another session (refresh the page or open a new tab) to check them separately. This can help isolate which of the two files is causing issues.
3. Include a preview of the top of each file, e.g. the output of `head` on the command line.
